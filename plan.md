# In Workflow Verifier Website Rebuild Plan (GovDash Style)

## 1. Site Structure & Pages

Based on the GovDash site, you’ll want the following pages:

- **Home** (Landing page with product summary, value props, testimonials, and CTA)
- **Product** (Detailed features, technical architecture, use cases)
- **Pricing** (Simple pricing or “Contact us for pricing”)
- **Customer Stories** (Testimonials, case studies)
- **Security** (Compliance, auditability, infrastructure)
- **Documentation** (API, integration, onboarding)
- **Careers** (Team, open roles)
- **Contact / Get Access** (Lead form, demo request)
- **Blog** (Optional, for thought leadership)

---

## 2. Design & Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS (as per your brief and GovDash’s modern look)
- **Routing:** React Router (for multi-page SPA)
- **Assets:** Logo, icons, and illustrations in a similar style (customized for your brand)
- **Typography & Colors:** Use a clean, sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Open Sans), with a blue/white/gray palette for trust and clarity.
